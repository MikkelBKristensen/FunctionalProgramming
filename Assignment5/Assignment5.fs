(* Exercise 5.6 *)

let rec bigListK c =
    function
    | 0 -> c []
    | n -> bigListK (fun res -> 1 :: c res) (n - 1)

(* TODO *)
(* The call bigListK id 130000 causes a stack overflow. 
   Analyse the problem and describe exactly why this happens. 
   Why is this not an iterative function?
   
   To make a compelling argument (and to prepare for the exam) you must make a step-by-step evalution of a call to
   bigListK. Test correctness of your evaluations by ensuring that they all evaluate to the same value. For example:
   
   (5 + 4) * 3 -->
   9 * 3 -->
   27
   
   If you input any of these lines into FSharp Interactive it will produce the same result. Do the same here and point
   to where you can see that this function is not tail recursive.
